# Migrate2GSA

Migrate2GSA documentation ---> https://aka.ms/Migrate2GSA

## What is Migrate2GSA?
Migrate2GSA is PowerShell-based migration toolkit designed to help organizations transition from SSE solutions to Global Secure Access (GSA). This toolkit provides automated configuration export, transformation, and a set of common GSA provisioning tools to streamline the transition process.

## Does Migrate2GSA only help on migrations from other SSE solutions?
No! Migrate2GSA can simplify your deployments as well. Simply create a csv file with your configuration and use the Entra Private Access and Entra Internet Access provisioning tools to create the config for you.

## Is this an official Microsoft product?
No. It is a community project that is maintained by Microsoft employees. The PowerShell toolkit is provided as-is and is not supported through any Microsoft support program or service. Please do not contact Microsoft support with any issues or concern.
